# Project Home

ADE's landing surface for the currently open project. Combines a
welcome/open-repo screen for fresh installs with a per-lane runtime
dashboard — managed processes, stacks, tests, and quick actions — for
loaded projects. The same surface (`RunPage`) is also the Run tab,
because "the project's home" and "the project's execution substrate"
have converged.

## Source file map

Renderer:

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/run/RunPage.tsx` — top-level
  page. Welcome screen + per-lane runtime dashboard in one component.
  ~1,300 lines.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/run/LaneRuntimeBar.tsx` —
  the bar at the top with "Running in: [lane]" selector, Start All /
  Stop All, stack buttons with aggregate status.

  strip for switching between stacks and the "all processes" view.

Main process (the substrate):

- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/processes/processService.ts` —

  per-lane port leases.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/lanes/laneProxyService.ts` —
  hostname proxy routing and preview URL management.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/lanes/runtimeDiagnosticsService.ts`
  — aggregated lane runtime health.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/agentTools/` — detects installed
  agent CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Aider, Continue).

Shared types:

- `apps/desktop/src/shared/types/config.ts` — `ProcessDefinition`,
  `ProcessRuntime`, `StackButtonDefinition`, `TestSuiteDefinition`,
  `LaneOverlayPolicy`, `ProxyConfig`, `PortLease`, `LanePreviewInfo`.

Preload bridge:

- `apps/desktop/src/preload/preload.ts` — `window.ade.processes`,
  `window.ade.project`, `window.ade.tests`.

## Composition

### Welcome screen

Rendered by `RunPage` when `useAppStore((s) => s.showWelcome)` is true
— typically when no project is open or the app was launched without
a prior session. Shows:

- ADE logo with a subtle pulse-glow
- "OPEN PROJECT" primary button → `appStore.openRepo()`
- recent projects list from `window.ade.project.listRecent()`, with
  display name, host path, lane count, and last-opened timestamp

Clicking a recent project calls `appStore.switchProjectToPath(path)`
which goes through the project open flow
(`adeProjectService.openProject`).

### Per-lane runtime dashboard

When a project is open and not in welcome state:

1. **LaneRuntimeBar** — top row with the currently-selected "Running
   in" lane. This uses `runLaneId ?? selectedLaneId` so users can
   override the Run tab's lane without changing the globally-selected
   lane. Aggregate status badges, stack buttons, Start All / Stop All.
2. **RunStackTabs** — horizontal tab strip. The leftmost tab is "All
   processes"; subsequent tabs correspond to
   `config.effective.stackButtons`. Each tab shows an aggregate
   status indicator and a process count.
3. **Processes grid / list** — renders a `CommandCard` per
   `ProcessDefinition` filtered by the active stack tab. Each card
   shows:
   - name + description from config
   - status dot (gray/stopped, yellow/starting or degraded,
     green/running, red/crashed)
   - readiness state (`unknown`, `ready`, `not_ready`)
   - pid and uptime when running
   - listening ports (when defined via port readiness)
   - action buttons (Start, Stop, Restart, Kill)
   - overflow menu (Edit, Move to stack, Delete)
4. **ProcessMonitor** — log viewer panel pinned at the bottom or on
   the side. Shows live stdout/stderr from the focused process and
   supports in-log search, filter, and auto-scroll. Also handles
   user-launched "run shell" sessions (one-off commands via the Run
   tab).
5. **RunNetworkPanel** (optional drawer) — shows port leases, proxy
   routes, and preview URLs for the current lane. Pulls from
   `window.ade.ports.*` and `window.ade.proxy.*`.
6. **AddCommandDialog** — full modal for adding or editing a process.
   Covers command, args, cwd, env, restart policy, readiness config
   (none / port / logRegex), dependency list, graceful shutdown
   timeout. Saves back to config via `projectConfig.save`.

### Quick run menu

`QuickRunMenu` is reachable through the command palette and provides
fuzzy-search over:

- processes (start/stop)
- test suites (run)
- stacks (start/stop)
- recent run-shell commands

Scoped to the current run lane.

## Data model

The dashboard is driven by:

- `ProjectConfigSnapshot.effective.processes: ProcessDefinition[]`
- `ProjectConfigSnapshot.effective.stackButtons: StackButtonDefinition[]`
- `ProjectConfigSnapshot.effective.testSuites: TestSuiteDefinition[]`
- `ProcessRuntime[]` for the selected lane (from
  `window.ade.processes.listRuntime(laneId)`)
- live `ProcessEvent` stream (`ade.processes.event`) filtered to
  runtime-only events with matching lane

Config comes from `projectConfigService`, which merges
`.ade/ade.yaml` (shared, committed) with `.ade/local.yaml` (local,
gitignored) into an effective config. See
[../onboarding-and-settings/configuration-schema.md](../onboarding-and-settings/configuration-schema.md)
for the schema.

## Runtime lifecycle (high level)

1. Page mounts. `refreshDefinitions` calls
   `processes.listDefinitions` once.
2. The runtime refresh is deferred ~140 ms behind first paint, then
   calls `processes.listRuntime(laneId)` to populate initial state.
3. The page subscribes to `processes.onEvent`, filtering runtime
   events to the current effective lane.
4. Start/stop/restart calls go through `window.ade.processes.*` and
   update the runtime map optimistically; the next runtime event
   confirms or corrects.
5. When the user switches lanes, the page disposes any user-launched
   run-shell sessions (`disposeRunShellSessions`) and calls
   `refreshRuntime` again.

## Loading model notes

The Run page hydrates in phases rather than as a cold boot on every
lane switch:

- project config and process/test definitions load independently of
  runtime state
- selected-lane runtime refreshes when the lane changes without
  reloading lane-independent metadata
- initial runtime hydration is deferred slightly behind first render
  (the 140 ms timer above)
- config saves refresh only the dependent slices instead of
  remounting the full page

## Gotchas

- `RunPage` owns both welcome and dashboard behavior; `showWelcome`
  is the gate. Side effects (e.g. process event subscription) still
  fire during welcome but return early, so the event bus stays clean.
- `runLaneId` lets Run override `selectedLaneId` without changing the
  global selection. Always read `runLaneId ?? selectedLaneId` when
  looking up runtime state.
- User-launched "run shell" sessions are tracked separately
  (`runShellSessions` in renderer state) and disposed on lane switch
  / page unmount. They share the `terminal_sessions` table but are
  tagged with `tool_type = "run-shell"`.
- Process events for other lanes are intentionally ignored by the
  filter in `onEvent`; do not rely on Run showing state for a
  non-selected lane.
- The stack aggregate status is computed in the renderer
  (`processUtils.ts`). It is not authoritative — the ultimate truth
  is the per-process `ProcessRuntime.status`.
- The ProcessMonitor log viewer reads `processes.getLogTail(...)`
  for initial hydration and then streams from the event bus. If you
  truncate a log file out-of-band, the viewer will briefly double-up
  lines until the next tail fetch.
